# College Algebra with Python | Project 3: Three Math Games

For this challenge, you need to create three math games using Python that incorporate different mathematical concepts and provide interactive experiences for the player. The games are as follows:

1. Scatter Plot Game
Objective: Randomly generate points on a graph, and the player must input the correct (x, y) coordinates.
Difficulty Enhancement: Increase the size of the graph to make it more challenging.
2. Algebra Practice Game
Objective: Generate one-step and two-step algebra problems with random integer values. The player must input the correct answer.
Difficulty Enhancement: Include both positive and negative values. Increase the magnitude of the numbers for added difficulty.
3. Projectile Game
Objective: Display a "wall" with a random height and location. The player must move sliders to adjust a parabolic path that clears the wall.
Difficulty Enhancement: Introduce a second level where players enter the coefficients a, b, and c for the quadratic equation directly, without using sliders.
How to Play
Scatter Plot Game: Players will see a scatter plot with points. They must correctly identify the coordinates of each point.
Algebra Practice Game: Players are presented with algebraic equations and must solve them to progress.
Projectile Game: Players will adjust a parabolic trajectory to successfully clear a wall by moving sliders or entering quadratic equation coefficients.
